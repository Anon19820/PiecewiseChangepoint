 ISSN = {00359246},
 abstract = {Model determination is a fundamental data analytic task. Here we consider the problem of choosing among a finite (without loss of generality we assume two) set of models. After briefly reviewing classical and Bayesian model choice strategies we present a general predictive density which includes all proposed Bayesian approaches that we are aware of. Using Laplace approximations we can conveniently assess and compare the asymptotic behaviour of these approaches. Concern regarding the accuracy of these approximations for small to moderate sample sizes encourages the use of Monte Carlo techniques to carry out exact calculations. A data set fitted with nested non-linear models enables comparisons between proposals and between exact and asymptotic values.},

An example using a latent class model with large-scale education data is provided to illustrate how easily JAGS can be implemented in R. We also cover details surrounding the many programs implementing JAGS. We conclude with a discussion of the newest features and upcoming developments. JAGS is constantly evolving and is developing into a flexible, user-friendly program with many benefits for Bayesian inference.},

One of the requirements for good practice in modelling is appropriate application of rates and probabilities. In spite of previous descriptions of appropriate use of rates and probabilities, confusions persist beyond a simple understanding of their definitions. The objective of this article is to provide a concise guide to understanding the issues surrounding the use of rates and probabilities reported in the literature in economic models, and an understanding of when and how to transform them appropriately. The article begins by defining rates and probabilities and shows the essential difference between the two measures. Appropriate conversions between rates and probabilities are discussed, and simple examples are provided to illustrate the techniques and pitfalls. How the transformed rates and probabilities may be used in economic models is then described and some recommendations are suggested.},

	abstract     = {Objectives. In June 2011, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Decision Support Unit published a Technical Support Document (TSD) providing recommendations on survival analysis for NICE technology appraisals (TAs). Survival analysis outputs are influential inputs into economic models estimating the cost-effectiveness of new cancer treatments. Hence, it is important that systematic and justifiable model selection approaches are used. This study investigates the extent to which the TSD recommendations have been followed since its publication. Methods. We reviewed NICE cancer TAs completed between July 2011 and July 2017. Information on survival analyses undertaken and associated critiques for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival were extracted from the company submissions, Evidence Review Group (ERG) reports, and final appraisal determination documents. Results. Information was extracted from 58 TAs. Only 4 (7\%) followed all TSD recommendations for OS outcomes. The vast majority (91\%) compared a range of common parametric models and assessed their fit to the data (86\%). Only a minority of TAs included an assessment of the shape of the hazard function (38\%) or proportional hazards assumption (40\%). Validation of the extrapolated portion of the survival function using external data was attempted in a minority of TAs (40\%). Extrapolated survival functions were frequently criticized by ERGs (71\%). Conclusions. Survival analysis within NICE TAs remains suboptimal, despite publication of the TSD. Model selection is not undertaken in a systematic way, resulting in inconsistencies between TAs. More attention needs to be given to assessing hazard functions and validation of extrapolated survival functions. Novel methods not described in the TSD have been used, particularly in the context of immuno-oncology, suggesting that an updated TSD may be of value.}
