# PiecewiseChangepoint


<!-- bookdown::html_document2: default -->
<!-- bookdown::pdf_document: default -->

The goal of PiecewiseChangepoint is to estimate the number and locations of change-points in pieceise exponential models. 


## Installation

You can install the released version of PiecewiseChangepoint from [GitHub](https://github.com/Anon19820/PiecewiseChangepoint) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("Anon19820/PiecewiseChangepoint")
```

## Worked Example

First we load the package and simulate some piecewise exponential data. 

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(survminer)
library(survival)
```

``` {r}
library(PiecewiseChangepoint)

## basic example code

set.seed(123)
n_obs =300
n_events_req=300
max_time =  2

rate = c(0.75,0.25)
t_change =1

df <- gen_piece_df(n_obs = n_obs,n_events_req = n_events_req,
                   num.breaks = length(t_change),rate = rate ,
                   t_change = t_change, max_time = max_time)
                   

```


We see the output of this dataframe below:

```{r, echo = F}
head(df)

```
_time_event_ represents the time the event would occur at in the absence of censoring, while _time_ is minimum of the censoring time and the event time. _status_ is an indicator variable if the event occurred at the corresponding time or if it was censored. Plotting this survival function we see a potential change in the hazard at around year 1. 

```{r, echo = F, warning=FALSE}
fit <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = df)
# Drawing curves
ggsurvplot(fit, palette = "#2E9FDF")

```


As noted in [@Bagust.2014], constant hazards are linear with respect to the cumulative hazard function, therefore, the change in hazards at approximately 1 year can be seen more clearly in this plot. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}

ggsurvplot(fit, palette = "#2E9FDF", fun = "cumhaz")


```

 Next we fit the model noting that only the time and status columns are required.

``` r

Collapsing_Model <- collapsing.model(df,
                                     n.iter = 20750,
                                     burn_in = 750,
                                     n.chains = 2,
                                     alpha.hyper = 1,
                                     beta.hyper1 = 1,
                                     beta.hyper2 = 1)


```

```{r, include=FALSE}
#pathway <- "C:/Users/phili/OneDrive/PhD/R packages/PiecewiseChangepoint/PiecewiseChangepoint/"
#Collapsing_Model<- readRDS(file = paste0(pathway,"Examples/Collapsing_Model.rds"))
Collapsing_Model<- readRDS(file = paste0("Examples/Collapsing_Model.rds"))
print(Collapsing_Model)


```

As we would expect the one change-point model has the highest posterior probability. 
```{r}
print(Collapsing_Model)
```

We should investigate the mixing of the chains to ensure they are satisfactory. The plot below indicates that is the case with jumps between models occurring frequently. This is an advantage of the method as other methods such as Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) [@Green.1995] require careful consideration of a bijective function to move between model dimensions. Often it is difficult to find such an appropriate bijective function which provides frequent jumps between models and therefore convergence can be quite slow.   


```{r}
chain.mixing(Collapsing_Model)
```

Once we are satisfied that there is good mixing and that we have run the model for long enough (20,000 simulations over 2 chains should be more than enough), we may want to look at a plot of the survivor function. In health economics we are typically interested in long term survival of our parametric models. In this situation we want a plot of the first 5 years which we can do using the _max_predict_ argument. The red lines show the individual posterior simulations and are a natural representation of the parameter uncertainty. 

```{r}
plot(Collapsing_Model, max_predict = 5)

```

Similarly we may also want to look at the hazard function. In this situation we only present the hazard up to the maximum time observed in the data. This is because by definition the hazard from the final interval will be the one which is extrapolated throughout the time horizon.

```{r}
plot(Collapsing_Model, type = "hazard")

```

By default the plot methods described above use all the posterior simulations. If for example, we were only interested in the 2 change-point model, we can specify this using the _chng.num_ argument. The green points indicate the mean location of the change-points. When plotting "all" of the simulations there is no sensible mean location of the change-points as there are different numbers of change-points.

```{r}
plot(Collapsing_Model, max_predict = 5, chng.num = 2)

```


## Comparison with other survival models

In health economics we are typically interested in picking between one of a number of alternative parametric models, although it is often appropriate to combine all models using model averaging [@Jackson.2010]. Model fit statistics can provide an assessment of fit to the __observed__ data, although, they do not guarantee the best fitting model will be appropriate for extrapolation. We can compare our fitted model with 6 commonly used parametric distributions. We fit the models using the programme JAGS [@Plummer.2003] and compare the model fit using two criteria Pseudo-Marginal Likelihood (PML) [@Gelfand.1994] and Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) [@Watanabe.2010]. In order to compare both measures of fit on the same scale we take the -2log(PML) and note that lower values indicate better fit.

```r
#This can take up to two minutes
mod_comp <-compare.surv.mods(Collapsing_Model)

#Returns a dataframe with the model fit results
mod_comp$mod.comp

```
We see that the Piecewise Exponential model fits the data considerably better than the other parametric models.  

```{r, echo = FALSE}
readRDS(file = paste0("Examples/mod_comp.rds"))

```

Because this is simulated data we know the actual event times and for the purpose of illustration we plot this so that we can compare how the predictions match the data. As expected the piecewise exponential model provides an accurate fit to the data across the time-horizon.

``` r

#We have the actual event times contained with df
df_true <- df
df_true$time <- df_true$time_event
df_true$status <- 1
df_true <- df_true %>% mutate(time = ifelse(time >10, 10, time))
df_true <- df_true %>% mutate(status = ifelse(time >=10, 0, status))

#Plot the data
add_km(mod_comp$plot_Surv_all, df_true, colour = "black")

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(paste0("Examples/plt_Survival.png"))

```

## Ensuring consistency when evalutating the model on different timescales

One criticism of methods which employ marginal likelihood for the purpose of model selection is that marginal likelihood is sensitive to the [prior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kisFIbkfDUs&ab_channel=BenLambert). This is distinct from the posterior distribution of the parameters which in the presence of sufficient data will dominate a (suitably vague) prior.

The prior on the hazard is $\lambda \sim \mathcal{G}(\alpha, \beta)$ where $\alpha,\beta$ are the shape and rate of the Gamma distribution. To improve the robustness of the results and incorporate uncertainty from this parameter we can introduce hyperpriors on $\beta$ which is also assumed to be generated from a gamma distribution $\beta \sim \mathcal{G}(\xi, \delta)$. 

However, to ensure that there is no discrepancy between the model selection using two different timescales, we need to take care when selecting $\alpha,\xi \text{ and } \delta$. We strongly recommend to keep $\alpha, \xi$ at their default values of 1, which results in an exponential prior distribution for both $\lambda, \beta$. Therefore the only value which will need to change is $\delta$. When we are changing timescales from years to days we need the gamma prior for $\beta$ to be scaled by 1/365 (i.e. the number of days in a year). Owing to the properties of the gamma distribution the equivalent scaled distribution is a $\mathcal{G}(1,1/365)$. When this prior is used we obtain very similar (differences due to Monte-Carlo error) posterior change-point probabilities. Although we suggest that $\xi$ (and $\alpha$) should be set to 1 we see from the below plot that a $\mathcal{G}(1,1)$ distribution is similar to $\mathcal{G}(2,2)$ distribution. Both have an expected value of 1 with variances 1 and 0.5 respectively and will give very similar inferences. However, it should be clear that both distributions are different to the $\mathcal{G}(0.2,0.2)$ distribution. Even in the presence of these different priors the posterior probability for the one change-point model is $\approx 70\%$ for the simulated dataset introduced in the first section.
